The Flask app uses the pymssql library to connect to the SQL server and execute SQL queries. When the app needs to access data from the database, it establishes a connection to the SQL server using the pymssql.connect() method and creates a pymssql.Cursor object to execute SQL queries on the server. The app can then use the cursor to execute SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and other SQL statements to access and manipulate data in the database.

To use the Flask app, you will need to have Docker installed on your local machine. You can then use Docker to start the SQL server container and the Flask app container. The Flask app will connect to the SQL server using the host.docker.internal hostname, which is automatically mapped to the IP address of the host machine. This allows the Flask app to access the SQL server running in the Docker container on the same machine.
